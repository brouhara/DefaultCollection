Loading the grunt plugins

To perform the tasks mentioned in the
above example,  we are using following
plugins,

◾grunt-contrib-uglify and
◾grunt-jsbeautifier

Remember to mention these plugins 
information in package.json file under
devDependencies section and run npm 
install.

Then load these plugins in the 
Gruntfile as follows,

> grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-uglify');
> grunt.loadNpmTasks("grunt-jsbeautifier");

Registering the tasks

The grunt.registerTask method is used
specify a default set of tasks that 
should run when the grunt command is
executed.

> grunt.registerTask('default', [ 'uglify:prodclient']);
> grunt.registerTask('dev', ['jsbeautifier']);

The first parameter of this method 
specifies the name of the task 
(in this case ‘default’) and the 
second contains an array of the tasks
you wish to be executed.

Running Grunt

Executing the grunt command in your 
terminal will run all of the tasks 
specified in your default task.

You can also run tasks individually 
by passing the task name to the grunt
command.

    grunt // Runs default tasks
grunt dev // Just runs the task with the name 'dev'
