Running Grunt

Executing the grunt command in your terminal
     will run all of the tasks specified in your default task.

You can also run tasks individually
     by passing the task name to the grunt command.

Example:
    
    // Run default tasks
    grunt 
    
    // Runs the task with the name 'dev'
    grunt dev
