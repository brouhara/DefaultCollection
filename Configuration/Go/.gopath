The GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your workspace.
It is likely the only environment variable you'll need to set when developing Go code. 

To get started, create a workspace directory and set GOPATH accordingly.

Your workspace can be located wherever you like, but we'll use $HOME/work in this document.
Note that this must not be the same path as your Go installation.

(Another common setup is to set GOPATH=$HOME.) 
$ mkdir $HOME/work
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/work

For convenience, add the workspace's bin subdirectory to your PATH: 
$ export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
