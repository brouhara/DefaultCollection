The packages from the standard library 
are given short paths such as "fmt" and "net/http".

For your own packages, you must choose a base path
 that is unlikely to collide with future additions 
 to the standard library or other external libraries. 

If you keep your code in a source repository somewhere,
 then you should use the root of that source repository 
 as your base path.
 
For instance, if you have a GitHub account at 
 github.com/user, that should be your base path. 

Note that you don't need to publish your code to a remote
 repository before you can build it. It's just a good habit 
 to organize your code as if you will publish it someday.
 
In practice you can choose any arbitrary path name, 
as long as it is unique to the standard library and
 greater Go ecosystem. 

We'll use github.com/user as our base path. Create a directory
inside your workspace in which to keep source code: 

$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/user
